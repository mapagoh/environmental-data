## ENVIRONMENTAL DATA IN THE NETHERLANDS AND NORTHWESTERN EUROPE

Environmental data is essential for scientific research in fields related to the environment, these data serve to make informed decisions about behavior and its impact. In short, it is a tool that allows us to understand and manage the environment and its natural resources.

Environmental data can be collected numerically or qualitatively, including components such as air, water, soil, biodiversity and climate, which allow us to understand the state of the environment and how it changes over time.

In this case, the environmental data mainly studied are those of the Netherlands and Northwestern Europe, in which the components of air quality, water, climate, biodiversity, and energy and emissions will be analyzed.

#### Air Quality:

One of the main sources of air pollution in the world are greenhouse gases, traffic, industry, agriculture, among others, which over the years in some countries of the world, due to government regulation, environmental policies restrictions and investment in clean and renewable technologies have reduced percentages of air pollution for their populations. In this case, the Netherlands and Northwestern Europe have been an example of these advances, because they have a comprehensive network of monitoring stations and data from constant monitoring are always required to take appropriate and corrective measures regarding to your air quality.

The following graphs present environmental data on CO2 emissions due to greenhouse gases between the years 2010 and 2020, for the Netherlands and Northwestern Europe.

The units used are tons of CO2 equivalent. It can be seen that countries such as Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland have a significant decrease over the years in the tons of CO2 disposed in the air. Its air quality can be said to be relatively good compared to other countries in the world, although there are still areas of concern in terms of air pollution.

In the case of Ireland and Austria, it is constant for a few years, that tend to decrease, but a larger scale is not seen as can be seen in the other countries. It can be said that its air quality compared to other countries in the world is relatively good, but there are challenges to continue to control and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.

Although the air quality in the Netherlands and Northwestern Europe is relatively good, measures must continue to be taken to improve it, since it can affect the health of people in the long term, changes in the climate and ecosystems. One of the measures that must be taken is the use of clean transport, it is important to encourage the use of electric vehicles, bicycles, public transport, among others, this can be done through discounts on public transport, implementation of free bicycles and construction of more lanes for bucycles without altering public roads.

Another alternative may be the control of industrial emissions, since they are an important source of air pollution, strict regulations must continue to be applied and constant control and monitoring must be carried out so that these regulations are complied with. The use of government incentives to companies and fines can be implemented to ensure compliance with the permissible limits of gases set forth in the air.

Finally, education on air quality is recommended since public awareness is crucial to reduce this type of pollution, it is important that people understand the effects that air pollution has on the health of people and the environment and in turn what can be done to reduce this impact. This goal can be helped to be achieved through governments and non-governmental organizations, which can offer educational programs and awareness campaigns.

#### Water:

Northwestern Europe is a large region that includes several countries, water quality may vary depending on the exact location, but in general, Northwestern Europe countries have good water quality compared to other regions in the world. According to the 2018 European Environment Agency report in North-West Europe, 85.2% of bathing water is considered to be of good quality, since it meets minimum quality standards.

As for the quality of drinking water, it is generally high and meets international standards according to the World Health Organization (OMS), most countries in Northwestern Europe have access to improved drinking water.

Regarding the quality of the water in the rivers, there is a certain percentage of contamination by nitrogen and phosphorus, which is a common problem in rivers and other bodies of water, especially in agricultural areas. According to the European Commission report, most of the rivers in Western and Central Europe exceed the limits established by the EU Water Framework Directive.

In general, water quality in Northwestern Europe has improved in recent decades thanks to the implementation of stricter water treatment policies and technologies that allow compliance with limits established by country and internationally.

In the Netherlands, drinking water is considered to be of high quality and is among the best in the world, surface water in the Netherlands is also of good quality, although it often requires treatment to meet quality standards. According to the World Health Organization (OMS), 100% of the population of the Netherlands have access to improved drinking water. According to the 2018 Europe Water Quality Report, 93.3% of bathing water in the Netherlands met minimum quality standards.

Surface water bodies are 70% monitored and meet environmental objectives for water quality according to the 2018 European Environment Agency report, although there are certain problems in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution, which It is a common problem in rivers and other bodies of water in the Netherlands, it exceeds the limits set by the EU Water Framework Directive and can cause algae blooms and the death of aquatic life.

It is important to know what is the water capacity that each country can supply, that is why the following graphs present the public water supply for the Netherlands and Northwestern Europe. These graphs are presented in millions of cubic meters, between the years 2010 and 2020.

To know the necessary amount of water in a population, it is necessary to know different factors such as the size of the population, the climate and the per capita consumption of water. This is a rough calculation and it should be noted that the actual amount of water needed for the population may vary depending on the factors mentioned above. It should be noted that this calculation does not take into account other uses of water, such as agriculture, industry and the environment.

For Belgium, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in 2020 the population was approximately 11.6 million people. In general terms, it is estimated that a person needs around 100 liters of water per day to meet their basic consumption and sanitation needs.

Therefore, if we multiply the daily water consumption per person by the total population of Belgium, we get a required amount of water of 1.16 million cubic meters/day. Taking into account the calculation made above, it can be said that Belgium used more than the desired amount in public water supply. This can cause the depletion of the natural water resource in the long term.

For Denmark, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in 2020 the population was approximately 5.8 million people. In general terms, it is estimated that a person needs around 100 liters of water per day to meet their basic consumption and sanitation needs.

Therefore, if we multiply the daily water consumption per person by the total population of Denmark, we get a required amount of water of 580,000 cubic meters/day. Taking this calculation into account and comparing it with the graph presented below, it can be said that Denmark is above the public water supply and this can cause the long-term depletion of the natural water resource.

For Luxembourg, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in 2020 the population was approximately 0.6 million people. In general terms, it is estimated that a person needs around 100 liters of water per day to meet their basic consumption and sanitation needs.

Therefore, if we multiply the daily water consumption per person by the total population of Luxembourg, we get a required amount of water of 60,000 cubic meters/day. Taking this figure into account and comparing it with the graph presented below, it can be said that the population of Luxembourg is above the annual expense that must be made of the public water supply, this can cause the depletion of the water resource in the long.

It can also be seen in the graph that in 2018 it was one of the years where there was more water consumption by a lot of difference compared to previous and following years.

For the Netherlands, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in 2020 the population of the Netherlands was approximately 17.4 million people. In general terms, it is estimated that a person needs around 100 liters of water per day to meet their basic consumption and sanitation needs.

Therefore, if we multiply the daily water consumption per person by the total population of the Netherlands, we get a required amount of water of 1.74 million cubic meters/day. Taking into account this calculation in comparison with the graph presented below, it can be said that the population of the Netherlands spends approximately 3 times more of the water that must be supplied annually, this can cause the depletion of the natural water resource in the long.

<img src="/images/11.PNG" style="width: 500px">

For Switzerland, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in 2020 the population of Switzerland was approximately 8.6 million people. In general terms, it is estimated that a person needs around 100 liters of water per day to meet their basic consumption and sanitation needs.

Therefore, if we multiply the daily water consumption per person by the total population of Switzerland, we get a required amount of water of 860,000 cubic meters/day. Taking into account the calculation made and the data in the graph presented below, it can be said that the population of Switzerland exceeds the used of public water supply that must be use annually according to the information given above, this can cause the depletion of the resource long-term water.

In general, all countries exceed the amount of water that should be used approximately, at least for human consumption. Excessive consumption of water, as previously stated, can deplete a country's water resources and reduce the availability of fresh water for the population and industrial and agricultural uses. This can cause droughts, water scarcity and conflicts over access to water.

Excessive water consumption can have a negative impact on the environment, especially on aquatic ecosystems such as lakes, rivers, groundwater, among others, and biodiversity. The excess extraction of water to meet the need for consumption can reduce the flow of rivers and streams, alter river ecosystems and reduce water quality.

It can also impact climate change, since some of the processes of extracting, treating and distributing water require energy and emit greenhouse gases, therefore it can increase the country's carbon footprint and contribute to global warming.

It is important that countries take immediate action regarding the use of water, promoting sustainable and efficient practices to avoid problems and ensure sustainable management of water resources, which is very important for human life, ecosystems, and aquatic life.

#### Biodiversity:

Biodiversity in the Netherlands and in the North West region of Europe is one of the richest and most diverse in the world despite being a densely populated and highly industrialized area. This region has managed to maintain a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, as well as a wide variety of animal and plant species.

One of the factors that has contributed to the conservation of biodiversity in this region is the environmental awareness of the inhabitants and local governments, through conservation and restoration policies and programs. Many natural habitats such as wetlands, forests, dunes and grasslands have been protected and restored, and measures have been implemented to reduce pollution and climate change, allowing species and ecosystems to recover and thrive.

It is estimated that in the Netherlands there are around 47,000 species of animals and plants, of which 50% are invertebrate animals and around 20% are plants, it also has a great diversity of fish, with more than 75 species of water sweet and around 200 marine species. For the Northwestern region of Europe it is said that there are more than 1,300 species of birds, which represents 40% of the birds in Europe and there are some of the oldest and most diverse forests in Europe such as the Bialowieza forest, which is a world heritage site and home to species such as the European bison and the golden eagle.

However, biodiversity in these regions faces challenges such as habitat fragmentation due to urbanization and infrastructure construction, water and air pollution, overfishing, and illegal hunting. Many species are also threatened due to habitat loss, pollution and climate change.

The graphs presented below show some threatened species, with the aim of indicating the status of mammals, birds, freshwater fish, reptiles, amphibians and vascular plants. This representation is of percentages of species threats that have been published.

For Austria, Luxembourg, Switzerland and the Netherlands, it can be seen that one of the most threatened species are reptiles and amphibians. These species are important for the ecosystem because they fulfill functions such as pest control, pollination and regulation of the food chain, they are also indicator species of ecosystem health and can indicate problems such as habitat degradation or pollution.

The threat of reptiles and amphibians can also have a negative impact on biodiversity in general, since these species are an important part of biological diversity. If they disappear, the unique genetic information they possess is lost, reducing genetic variability and the ecosystem's ability to adapt to environmental changes.

In the case of marine fish, there is no information for the countries of Austria and Switzerland, therefore it is not known what percentage of threat this species is.

In the case of Luxembourg, there is no information on marine fish, mosses and lichens, therefore it is not known what percentage of threat these species are.

<img src="/images/17.PNG" style="width: 600px">

For Belgium, it is noted that the most threatened species are lichens and reptiles. This can have a significant impact on ecosystems as reptiles are top predators in many ecosystems and their disappearance can destabilize food chains. Furthermore, lichens are symbiotic photosynthetic organisms that are important for air quality and as a food source for herbivores. They are also indicators of air quality, since they are very sensitive to pollution.

<img src="/images/14.PNG" style="width: 600px">

For Denmark, it can be seen that the most threatened species are birds and amphibians. This can have a significant impact on ecosystems and biodiversity, since amphibians are important as indicators of water quality and ecosystem health. They are also predators of insects and other invertebrates, which makes them an important element of food chains. Birds are important for pollination, seed dispersal, and pest control. Some birds are also predators and play an important role in regulating the populations of other animals.

In the case of marine fish, there is no information for the country of Denmark, therefore it is not known what percentage of threat this species is.

<img src="/images/15.PNG" style="width: 600px">

In general, in most countries the species that are threatened with the highest percentage are above 30%. This situation is worrisome and work must be done on the conservation and restoration of ecosystems and species, as well as the awareness and education of the population on the importance of biodiversity and its regulation with the quality of life of the inhabitants and the sustainable development of the region.

It is important to consider biodiversity in the design and implementation of development projects, since any human activity can have an impact on ecosystems and species, constant environmental assessments and mitigation plans must be carried out to minimize negative impacts and maximize benefits. for biodiversity. In addition, sustainable practices in industry and agriculture should be encouraged, and the use of clean and renewable technologies promoted.

Biodiversity in the Netherlands and in Northwestern Europe is a natural wealth that must be protected and preserved for future generations. The community and governments must work together to ensure that development is carried out in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner.
