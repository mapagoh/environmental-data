## ENVIRONMENTAL DATA IN THE NETHERLANDS AND NORTHWESTERN EUROPE

Environmental data is essential for scientific research in fields related to the environment, these data serve to make informed decisions about behavior and its impact. In short, it is a tool that allows us to understand and manage the environment and its natural resources.

Environmental data can be collected numerically or qualitatively, including components such as air, water, soil, biodiversity and climate, which allow us to understand the state of the environment and how it changes over time.

In this case, the environmental data mainly studied are those of the Netherlands and Northwestern Europe, in which the components of air quality, water quality, climate, biodiversity, and energy and emissions will be analyzed.

#### Air Quality:

One of the main sources of air pollution in the world are greenhouse gases, traffic, industry, agriculture, among others, which over the years in some countries of the world, due to government regulation, environmental policies restrictions and investment in clean and renewable technologies have reduced percentages of air pollution for their populations. In this case, the Netherlands and Northwestern Europe have been an example of these advances, because they have a comprehensive network of monitoring stations and data from constant monitoring are always required to take appropriate and corrective measures regarding to your air quality.

The following graph presents the table with environmental data on greenhouse gases between the years 2010 and 2020, from the Netherlands and Northwestern Europe.

The units used are tons of CO2 equivalent. It can be seen that countries such as Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland have a significant decrease over the years in the tons of CO2 disposed in the air. Its air quality can be said to be relatively good compared to other countries in the world, although there are still areas of concern in terms of air pollution.

In the case of Ireland, it is constant for a few years, that tend to decrease, but a larger scale is not seen as can be seen in the other countries. It can be said that its air quality compared to other countries in the world is relatively good, but there are challenges to continue to control and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.

Although the air quality in the Netherlands and Northwestern Europe is relatively good, measures must continue to be taken to improve it, since it can affect the health of people in the long term, changes in the climate and ecosystems. One of the measures that must be taken is the use of clean transport, it is important to encourage the use of electric vehicles, bicycles, public transport, among others, this can be done through discounts on public transport, implementation of free bicycles and construction of more lanes for bucycles without altering public roads.

Another alternative may be the control of industrial emissions, since they are an important source of air pollution, strict regulations must continue to be applied and constant control and monitoring must be carried out so that these regulations are complied with. The use of government incentives to companies and fines can be implemented to ensure compliance with the permissible limits of gases set forth in the air.

Finally, education on air quality is recommended since public awareness is crucial to reduce this type of pollution, it is important that people understand the effects that air pollution has on the health of people and the environment and in turn what can be done to reduce this impact. This goal can be helped to be achieved through governments and non-governmental organizations, which can offer educational programs and awareness campaigns.

#### Water quality:

Northwestern Europe is a large region that includes several countries, water quality may vary depending on the exact location, but in general, Northwestern Europe countries have good water quality compared to other regions in the world. According to the 2018 European Environment Agency report in North-West Europe, 85.2% of bathing water is considered to be of good quality, since it meets minimum quality standards.

As for the quality of drinking water, it is generally high and meets international standards according to the World Health Organization (OMS), most countries in Northwestern Europe have access to improved drinking water.

Regarding the quality of the water in the rivers, there is a certain percentage of contamination by nitrogen and phosphorus, which is a common problem in rivers and other bodies of water, especially in agricultural areas. According to the European Commission report, most of the rivers in Western and Central Europe exceed the limits established by the EU Water Framework Directive.

In general, water quality in Northwestern Europe has improved in recent decades thanks to the implementation of stricter water treatment policies and technologies that allow compliance with limits established by country and internationally.

In the Netherlands, drinking water is considered to be of high quality and is among the best in the world, surface water in the Netherlands is also of good quality, although it often requires treatment to meet quality standards. According to the World Health Organization (OMS), 100% of the population of the Netherlands have access to improved drinking water. According to the 2018 Europe Water Quality Report, 93.3% of bathing water in the Netherlands met minimum quality standards.

Surface water bodies are 70% monitored and meet environmental objectives for water quality according to the 2018 European Environment Agency report, although there are certain problems in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution, which It is a common problem in rivers and other bodies of water in the Netherlands, it exceeds the limits set by the EU Water Framework Directive and can cause algae blooms and the death of aquatic life.
